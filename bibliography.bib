abstract = {In this article, we introduce the reader to discrete-event simulation. The concepts
of system and model, system state, entities, attributes and delays are defined in
the general context of simulation. Using these concepts, event-scheduling, process-interaction,
and activity-scanning perspectives are briefly described. To demonstrate the use of
the concepts, a discrete system is modeled using the event-scheduling perspective.
Simulation languages are classified in terms of the type of system being modeled,
the application level, and the perspective taken. The features of a simulation language
are discussed. Lastly, basic information is provided about an assortment of discrete-event
simulation languages.},

abstract="The goal in analyzing output data from running a simulation model is to make a valid statistical inference about the initial and long-term average behavior of the system based on the sample average from N replicate simulation runs. Output Analysis is the analysis of data generated by a simulation run to predict system performance or compare performance of two or more system designs. In stochastic simulations, multiple runs are always necessary. The output of a single run can be viewed as a sample of size 1. Output analysis is needed because output data from a simulation exhibits random variability when random number generators are used. i.e., two different random number streams will produce two sets of output which (probably) will differ. The statistical tool mainly used is the confidence interval for the mean.",
